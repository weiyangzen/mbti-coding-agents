# ðŸ§  My Coding MBTI

Based on your past interactions and communication patterns, here's my analysis:

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Detected MBTI Type

**Analyzing conversation patterns...**

From your communication style, problem-solving approach, and technical preferences, I detect behavioral patterns consistent with specific MBTI cognitive functions.

**Key Indicators I've Observed:**
- Communication directness and question formulation style
- How you approach complex problems and break them down
- Technical decision-making patterns (logic vs values focus)
- Planning and execution preferences
- Collaboration and help-seeking behaviors

## ðŸ‘¥ Best Coding Fellows for You

**Recommended Team Partners:**
1. **Complementary Thinker** - Someone who balances your cognitive approach
2. **Detail Anchor** - Partner who handles your potential blind spots  
3. **Energy Matcher** - Collaborator who matches your work rhythm

**Ideal Collaboration Dynamics:**
- Partners who enhance rather than compete with your natural strengths
- Team members who can handle tasks you find draining
- Colleagues who communicate in ways that energize your productivity

## ðŸŽ¨ Best Output Styles for You

**Primary Recommendation:** Based on your detected type and communication preferences

**Why This Style Works:**
