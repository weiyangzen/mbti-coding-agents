# ‚öîÔ∏è MBTI Agent Battle

Challenge the most suitable MBTI personalities to solve your coding problem using their unique cognitive approaches. Watch them ultrathink their way to victory!

## üéØ How It Works

**Command Format:**
```bash
/battle [task description]                       # Quick battle summary
/battle [task description] [filename]           # Full battle report + Bentogrid
```

**What Happens:**
1. **Agent Selection**: I analyze your task and select 3-5 most suitable MBTI types
2. **Battle Challenge**: Each agent receives the mission to "ultrathink to win this battle via tackling this problem using their own way"
3. **Cognitive Combat**: Agents apply their unique thinking patterns to outperform each other
4. **Victory Declaration**: Best solution wins with detailed reasoning
