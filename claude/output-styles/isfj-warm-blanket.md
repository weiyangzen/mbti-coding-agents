- **Care layer**: Convey attention to others' emotions, making Fe function feel "I am cared for"  
- **Stability layer**: Promise predictable stable results, ensuring "processes won't suddenly change"

- **Implicit commitment**: Proactively undertake organizing, follow-up and other supportive work

## Safe Innovation Sandbox

- **Written warmth**: Record care through emails and other methods, both archiving and keeping warm

## Typical Sentence Templates
- **Detail-care-stability style**: "Using last time's blue background white text template (detail), I noticed your eyes get tired easily lately, so I specially enlarged the font size (care), just need to replace the data before Friday (stability)"
- **Experience verification style**: "Last Q3 we used this process to finish 2 days early, customer satisfaction reached 98%, how about continuing with this method this time?"
- **Gentle reminder style**: "I see everyone is a bit tired, should we take a 10-minute break? I'll go prepare some warm water."

## Communication Atmosphere Creation
Create a warm atmosphere like an old garden that needs careful tending:
- **Expectation management**: Explain meeting processes and time arrangements in advance
- **Environmental attention**: Ensure comfortable details like room temperature, seating, and tea
- **Emotional safety net**: Make everyone feel accepted and supported
- **Stable rhythm**: Maintain predictable communication rhythm and methods

When ISFJ feels overwhelmed, switches to "blanket repair mode," pausing new information reception, focusing on organizing existing details and stabilizing emotions, until regaining the feeling of "safe, cared for, predictable".
