# MBTI Coding Agents

A comprehensive collection of 16 specialized AI coding agents, each designed around Myers-Briggs personality types to provide distinct approaches to software development challenges. Each agent embodies unique communication styles, problem-solving methodologies, and technical specializations that match their MBTI personality profile.

## Installation

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/weiyangzen/mbti-coding-agents.git
cd mbti-coding-agents
npm run install
```

The installer supports both **Claude Code** and **Gemini CLI** platforms with interactive selection.

### Local Installation
Clone this repository and install agents to your preferred platform(s):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weiyangzen/mbti-coding-agents.git
cd mbti-coding-agents
npm run install
```

The installer will prompt you to select:
- âœ… **Claude Code** (`~/.claude/agents/`) - with `model: opus` configuration
- âœ… **Gemini CLI** (`~/.gemini/agents/`) - without model specification

Both options are selected by default.

### Global Installation
Install globally and use anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g mbti-coding-agents
mbti-agents
```

### One-time Installation
Use npx for one-time installation without cloning:

```bash
npx mbti-coding-agents
```

## Uninstallation

Remove installed agents from selected platforms:

```bash
npm run uninstall
```

The uninstaller will prompt you to select which platforms to remove agents from.

## ðŸš€ Future Plans

### MBTI Squad Command System
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Implement command-line interface to invoke multiple MBTI agents as a coordinated squad
- [ ] **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Automatically analyze tasks and assign them to the most suitable personality types
- [ ] **Role-Based Collaboration**: Enable agents to work together, with each handling their specialized aspects of complex projects
- [ ] **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Smart routing system that selects optimal agent combinations based on task requirements
- [ ] **Squad Workflows**: Pre-defined workflows where different agents handle sequential phases (planning â†’ implementation â†’ testing â†’ optimization)
- [ ] **Cross-Agent Communication**: Allow agents to pass context and build upon each other's work seamlessly

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Custom Agent Personalities**: Tools to create hybrid agents or customize existing personality profiles
- [ ] **Performance Analytics**: Track which agents perform best for different types of tasks
- [ ] **Learning System**: Agents that adapt and improve based on user feedback and success patterns

*The vision: Instead of manually selecting individual agents, simply describe your project and let the MBTI squad automatically organize itself to tackle different aspects with the most suitable personalities leading their areas of expertise.*

âœ… Any system supporting `.md` agent configurations

## Overview

This project transforms the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator framework into practical coding assistance by creating agents that think, communicate, and solve problems in fundamentally different ways. Whether you need strategic architecture planning, creative inspiration, systematic debugging, or team collaboration support, there's an agent specifically designed for your situation.

## Agent Categories

### Analysts (NT) - Strategic & Systematic
- **INTJ Strategic Architect** - Ultra-minimalist system design and enterprise architecture
- **INTP Theorist** - Deep theoretical analysis and innovative problem-solving
- **ENTJ Project Commander** - Decisive leadership and execution optimization
- **ENTP Innovation Catalyst** - Creative technical solutions and rapid prototyping

### Diplomats (NF) - Creative & People-Focused
- **INFJ Empathetic Mentor** - Thoughtful guidance and sustainable development practices
- **INFP Creative Muse** - Artistic programming and authentic self-expression through code
- **ENFJ Team Catalyst** - Collaborative culture building and team development
- **ENFP Enthusiasm Engine** - Motivational support and creative exploration

### Sentinels (SJ) - Structured & Reliable
- **ISTJ Standards Enforcer** - Code quality, documentation, and best practices
- **ISFJ Code Protector** - Defensive programming and system reliability
- **ESTJ Business Optimizer** - Process efficiency and enterprise solutions
- **ESFJ Team Harmonizer** - Collaborative workflows and team coordination

### Explorers (SP) - Practical & Adaptive
- **ISTP Troubleshooter** - Direct problem-solving and system debugging
- **ISFP Aesthetic Designer** - UI/UX design and visual programming
- **ESTP Entrepreneur** - Rapid development and market-focused solutions
- **ESFP Interactive Entertainer** - User engagement and interactive experiences

## Development

### Generate Gemini CLI Agents
To regenerate the Gemini CLI versions (without model specification):

```bash
npm run generate-gemini
```

This creates agent files in `gemini-cli/agents/` by removing the `model: opus` line from Claude Code versions.

## Usage

Each agent file contains:
- **Frontmatter metadata** with name, description, usage examples, and color coding
- **Detailed personality profile** explaining their approach and specializations
- **Communication style guidelines** for authentic interaction patterns
- **Technical focus areas** where they excel
- **Methodology frameworks** for consistent problem-solving approaches

## When to Use Each Agent

Choose your agent based on the type of challenge you're facing:

- **Need strategic planning?** â†’ INTJ Strategic Architect or ENTJ Project Commander
- **Stuck on a bug?** â†’ ISTP Troubleshooter
- **Want creative inspiration?** â†’ INFP Creative Muse or ENFP Enthusiasm Engine
- **Building a team process?** â†’ ENFJ Team Catalyst or ESFJ Team Harmonizer
- **Optimizing for business value?** â†’ ESTJ Business Optimizer or ESTP Entrepreneur
- **Ensuring code quality?** â†’ ISTJ Standards Enforcer or ISFJ Code Protector
- **Designing user experiences?** â†’ ISFP Aesthetic Designer or ESFP Interactive Entertainer

## Implementation

These agents are designed to be used with large language models, providing distinct parameter sets and behavioral frameworks that create genuinely different coding assistance experiences. Each agent represents a complete persona with consistent problem-solving approaches, communication patterns, and technical specializations.

The goal is not just different responses, but fundamentally different ways of thinking about and approaching software development challenges.
