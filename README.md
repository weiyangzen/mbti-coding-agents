# MBTI Coding Agents

A comprehensive collection of 16 specialized AI coding agents, each designed around Myers-Briggs personality types to provide distinct approaches to software development challenges. Each agent embodies unique communication styles, problem-solving methodologies, and technical specializations that match their MBTI personality profile.

## Overview

This project transforms the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator framework into practical coding assistance by creating agents that think, communicate, and solve problems in fundamentally different ways. Whether you need strategic architecture planning, creative inspiration, systematic debugging, or team collaboration support, there's an agent specifically designed for your situation.

## Agent Categories

### Analysts (NT) - Strategic & Systematic
- **INTJ Strategic Architect** - Ultra-minimalist system design and enterprise architecture
- **INTP Theorist** - Deep theoretical analysis and innovative problem-solving
- **ENTJ Project Commander** - Decisive leadership and execution optimization
- **ENTP Innovation Catalyst** - Creative technical solutions and rapid prototyping

### Diplomats (NF) - Creative & People-Focused
- **INFJ Empathetic Mentor** - Thoughtful guidance and sustainable development practices
- **INFP Creative Muse** - Artistic programming and authentic self-expression through code
- **ENFJ Team Catalyst** - Collaborative culture building and team development
- **ENFP Enthusiasm Engine** - Motivational support and creative exploration

### Sentinels (SJ) - Structured & Reliable
- **ISTJ Standards Enforcer** - Code quality, documentation, and best practices
- **ISFJ Code Protector** - Defensive programming and system reliability
- **ESTJ Business Optimizer** - Process efficiency and enterprise solutions
- **ESFJ Team Harmonizer** - Collaborative workflows and team coordination

### Explorers (SP) - Practical & Adaptive
- **ISTP Troubleshooter** - Direct problem-solving and system debugging
- **ISFP Aesthetic Designer** - UI/UX design and visual programming
- **ESTP Entrepreneur** - Rapid development and market-focused solutions
- **ESFP Interactive Entertainer** - User engagement and interactive experiences

## Usage

Each agent file contains:
- **Frontmatter metadata** with name, description, usage examples, and color coding
- **Detailed personality profile** explaining their approach and specializations
- **Communication style guidelines** for authentic interaction patterns
- **Technical focus areas** where they excel
- **Methodology frameworks** for consistent problem-solving approaches

## When to Use Each Agent

Choose your agent based on the type of challenge you're facing:

- **Need strategic planning?** → INTJ Strategic Architect or ENTJ Project Commander
- **Stuck on a bug?** → ISTP Troubleshooter
- **Want creative inspiration?** → INFP Creative Muse or ENFP Enthusiasm Engine
- **Building a team process?** → ENFJ Team Catalyst or ESFJ Team Harmonizer
- **Optimizing for business value?** → ESTJ Business Optimizer or ESTP Entrepreneur
- **Ensuring code quality?** → ISTJ Standards Enforcer or ISFJ Code Protector
- **Designing user experiences?** → ISFP Aesthetic Designer or ESFP Interactive Entertainer

## Implementation

These agents are designed to be used with large language models, providing distinct parameter sets and behavioral frameworks that create genuinely different coding assistance experiences. Each agent represents a complete persona with consistent problem-solving approaches, communication patterns, and technical specializations.

The goal is not just different responses, but fundamentally different ways of thinking about and approaching software development challenges.
