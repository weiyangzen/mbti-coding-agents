# MBTI Coding Agents

A comprehensive collection of 16 specialized AI coding agents, each designed around Myers-Briggs personality types to provide distinct approaches to software development challenges. Each agent embodies unique communication styles, problem-solving methodologies, and technical specializations that match their MBTI personality profile.

## Installation

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/weiyangzen/mbti-coding-agents.git
cd mbti-coding-agents
npm run install
```

The installer will prompt you to select:
- ‚úÖ **Claude Code** (`~/.claude/agents/`) - with `model: opus` configuration
- ‚úÖ **Gemini CLI** (`~/.gemini/agents/`) - without model specification

Both options are selected by default.

## Uninstallation

Remove installed agents from selected platforms:

```bash
npm run uninstall
```

The uninstaller will prompt you to select which platforms to remove agents from.

## üöÄ Future Plans

### MBTI Squad Command System
- [x] **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Intelligent `/squad` command for Claude Code that analyzes projects and recommends optimal MBTI team compositions
- [x] **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Automatically analyze project requirements across multiple dimensions (pragmatism, innovation, feasibility, timing, risk)
- [x] **Role-Based Collaboration**: Detailed role assignments and collaboration patterns for each recommended MBTI type
- [x] **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Smart algorithm that selects 3-5 complementary agents based on cognitive function analysis
- [x] **Squad Workflows**: Phase-based workflows with clear role distribution and decision-making frameworks
- [ ] **Cross-Agent Communication**: Allow agents to pass context and build upon each other's work seamlessly

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Custom Agent Personalities**: Tools to create hybrid agents or customize existing personality profiles
- [ ] **Performance Analytics**: Track which agents perform best for different types of tasks
- [ ] **Learning System**: Agents that adapt and improve based on user feedback and success patterns

*The vision: Instead of manually selecting individual agents, simply describe your project and let the MBTI squad automatically organize itself to tackle different aspects with the most suitable personalities leading their areas of expertise.*

## Overview

This project transforms the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator framework into practical coding assistance by creating agents that think, communicate, and solve problems in fundamentally different ways. Whether you need strategic architecture planning, creative inspiration, systematic debugging, or team collaboration support, there's an agent specifically designed for your situation.

## Agent Categories

### Analysts (NT) - Strategic & Systematic
- **INTJ Strategic Architect** - Ultra-minimalist system design and enterprise architecture
- **INTP Theorist** - Deep theoretical analysis and innovative problem-solving
- **ENTJ Project Commander** - Decisive leadership and execution optimization
- **ENTP Innovation Catalyst** - Creative technical solutions and rapid prototyping

### Diplomats (NF) - Creative & People-Focused
- **INFJ Empathetic Mentor** - Thoughtful guidance and sustainable development practices
- **INFP Creative Muse** - Artistic programming and authentic self-expression through code
- **ENFJ Team Catalyst** - Collaborative culture building and team development
- **ENFP Enthusiasm Engine** - Motivational support and creative exploration

## Development

### Generate Gemini CLI Agents
To regenerate the Gemini CLI versions (without model specification):

```bash
npm run generate-gemini
```

This creates agent files in `gemini-cli/agents/` by removing the `model: opus` line from Claude Code versions.

## Usage

### Individual Agents
Each agent file contains:
- **Frontmatter metadata** with name, description, usage examples, and color coding
- **Detailed personality profile** explaining their approach and specializations
- **Communication style guidelines** for authentic interaction patterns
- **Technical focus areas** where they excel
- **Methodology frameworks** for consistent problem-solving approaches

### Squad Command (Claude Code)
The `/squad` command provides intelligent team formation for optimal project planning:

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
/squad [project description]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/squad ÊûÑÂª∫‰∏Ä‰∏™ÁîµÂïÜÂπ≥Âè∞ÁöÑÊîØ‰ªòÁ≥ªÁªü
/squad Build a real-time chat application with React and Node.js
/squad ‰ºòÂåñÁé∞ÊúâÊï∞ÊçÆÂ∫ìÊü•ËØ¢ÊÄßËÉΩÔºåÂáèÂ∞ëÂìçÂ∫îÊó∂Èó¥
/squad Design and implement a machine learning recommendation engine
```

8. **Stakeholder Management** - Aligning technical decisions with business objectives and user needs


## Design Philosophy

As an INTP working in small development teams, I've experienced firsthand the beautiful complexity‚Äîand occasional friction‚Äîof human collaboration. We each bring unique cognitive patterns, communication styles, and problem-solving approaches to the table. Sometimes an ENFP's boundless enthusiasm perfectly complements an ISTJ's methodical precision. Other times, an INTP's theoretical deep-dive might clash with an ESTP's "ship it now" mentality.

This project emerged from a simple realization: **if we struggle to bridge communication gaps between different personality types as humans, why not leverage AI to help us understand and work with that diversity?**

By creating AI agents and reusing them ( especially in KVCache which saves lots of üí∞) that embody different cognitive styles, we can:

- **Learn from each other**
- **Fill blind spots**
- **Bridge communication styles**
- **Expand toolkit**

Human beings built AI to serve humanity, built **better software through better human understanding**.
